               I was born and raised as a Third Culture Kid in an expat family that has been on the move since 1990. I attended international schools across Asia and have lived in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, the UK, and the US.
               </p>
               <p>

After completing my Dual Master’s degree in international and world history from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, I worked as a freelance journalist in New York City, writing about pop culture and entertainment for online publications such as Mic (formerly PolicyMic) and Contently.
</p>
<p>
From 2014-2017, I was a staff reporter for the Features section of the English-language daily newspaper, the Taipei Times, where I covered art, culture, food, lifestyle, and social issues. During this time, I wrote a column about the city's burgeoning craft beer scene. As the newspaper's art critic, I wrote a weekly column about art exhibitions and fairs.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am freelancing full-time again, writing travel, food, and art stories - mostly from Asia - for in-flight magazines of airlines including EVA Air, Philippine Airlines, Scoot, SilkAir, and Hong Kong Airlines. My work has been published in Slate, Jetsetter, Marriott Traveler, Roads & Kingdoms, Time Out, and Travel in Taiwan, the official magazine of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau. I have filed stories from Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Myanmar. During my spare time, I surf and draw doodles.
</p>
<p>
Some fun stories I've covered include drinking <a target="_blank" href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/5-oclock-somewhere/millet-wine-with-the-aborigines-of-taiwan/">millet wine</a> with Saisiyat Aborigines during a sacred, centuries-old ritual, having coffee with a former presidential secretary who now runs an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2014/11/20/2003604850">organic restaurant/activist bookstore</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2015/hanging-ten-in-taiwan/">surfing with some of Taiwan’s best surfers</a> who think it’s crazy that many people on this subtropical island still don’t know how to swim. I've also written about <a target="_blank" href="http://mic.com/articles/65707/meet-the-hello-kitty-jet-the-world-s-cutest-airplane">Hello Kitty airplanes</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://mic.com/articles/78193/the-korean-clothing-trend-breaking-down-dating-barriers">couple t-shirts</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://contently.net/2014/07/25/stories/im-traveler-writer-serious-problem-travel-writing/">‘elitism’ of travel writing</a>.
